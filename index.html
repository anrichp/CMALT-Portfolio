            <h2 class="border-bottom pb-2">Contextual Statement</h2>
            
            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Professional Background</h3>
            <p>I have been working with learning technology for over 15 years. My career began at Hatfield Christian Online School, one of the first online schools in South Africa. There, I assisted with server administration of the Moodle stack based on LAMP, provided support to teachers using the platform, and worked alongside instructional designers to build content on Moodle.</p>
            <p>Subsequently, I moved to a broadcast television environment, where I gained valuable experience. During this time, I continued freelance work for Hatfield Christian Online School and added Social Justice South Africa as a client. For Social Justice, I performed a full installation of their Moodle instance hosted on Digital Ocean as a droplet, providing ongoing technical support for their Moodle stack on the server side, as well as support to their users and content creators.</p>
            <p>In 2019, I immigrated to the UK and joined Kaplan Open Learning, an online higher education provider working with the University of Liverpool. In my role as a Learning Technology Manager, my core tasks include administration of the Moodle LMS, building content on the platform, enrolling students, providing second-line support to student support teams, and working with academics and subject materials specialists to ensure they understand what can be achieved on the platform and to build engaging experiences for our students.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I have completed my Master's in Computer Science with a specific focus on building a Moodle plugin that evaluates text complexity on a Moodle course page and provides remediation suggestions. This has expanded my learning technology experience and allowed me to learn about developing plugins for the Moodle ecosystem.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Current Role and Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>As the Learning Technology Manager at Kaplan Open Learning, my main responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Managing a team of two people: a learning platform administrator and a learning technologist.</li>
                <li>Building content on the platform.</li>
                <li>Providing advanced support to the student support team when issues are beyond their understanding.</li>
                <li>Offering support to academic teams when required.</li>
                <li>Working alongside an instructional design team to build content on the Moodle LMS for modules offered across various programmes.</li>
                <li>Acting as the system administrator for the Moodle instance, ensuring students have a seamless experience on our LMS.</li>
                <li>Overseeing Moodle-side administration, despite using a Moodle provider for hosting our server environment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">Motivation for Pursuing CMALT</h3>
            <p>I am pursuing CMALT certification for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To demonstrate and evidence my learning technology experience through the acquisition of this accreditation.</li>
                <li>To become part of a community of professionals from whom I can learn and grow.</li>
                <li>To participate in building communities where we can learn from one another and critically analyse each other's approaches to the learning technology field.</li>
            </ul>
